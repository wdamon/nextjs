In the May 2021 episode, Will and Evan discuss the third grave precept: Not misusing sex, but maintaining integrity in personal relations. We discuss the intersections between spiritual practice and the reality of being men in a deeply sexist, patriarchal society. In our discussion of how these social structures permeate Buddhist and other spiritual communities, we consider the troubling history of sexual abuse scandals in western Buddhism, and consider the crucial relationship between desire, mindful attention, and religious ethics.
