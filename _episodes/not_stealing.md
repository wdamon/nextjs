Will and Evan spent the month of April, 2021 practicing with the second grade precept: Not stealing, or accepting what is offered as a gift. In this episode, we talk about the various forms that stealing -- and its root, grasping -- can take in our daily lives. We look at the relationship between consumption, power, privilege, and entitlement, and consider how the practice of right mindfulness can help us engage with desire and grasping more skillfully. And we conclude with a discuss of the second preceptâ€™s positive aspect: Accepting what life offers us.
