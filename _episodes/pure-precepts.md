In this episode on the Three Pure Precepts (not doing harm, doing good, and saving all beings), Will and Evan discuss the challenge of realizing these three great vows as a day-to-day practice. We also consider the difficulty of approaching ethical practices as newcomers to practice: how can we engage with the precepts in a way that helps us bring more awareness to our behaviour, without feeling worse about ourselves when, inevitably, we fall short of our own aspirations as Bodhisattvas? How can the precepts serve as “safety rails,” which remind us to consider ourselves and others, and moments of mindfulness? (31 minutes)
