In this episode Will and Evan take on the first “pure precept”: Not killing, but nurturing life. How do we as Buddhists approach the question of eating meat? And how does it feel to try to be more intentional and compassionate with regards to our diets? We talk about how our society normalizes eating animals and how we can bring more awareness to the practice. We also talk about mean-spiritedness, and the myriad ways we habitually harm ourselves and those around us through small acts of unkindness and impatience. And finally, we ask what it means to nurture life and care for life, particularly when we are feeling upset, miserable, and exhausted? (30 minutes)
